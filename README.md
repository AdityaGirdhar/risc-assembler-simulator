# Custom Assembler and Simulator
Here's an assembler and simulator based on a hypothetical instruction set architecture implemented in Python3, along with automated testing routines.

This is a project for the course CSE112 - Computer Organisation, IIIT Delhi.

## Adding code
* Add the assembler code in `Simple-Assembler` directory
* Add the simulator code in the `Simple-Simulator` directory
* Make sure that both the assembler and the simulator read from `stdin`
* Make sure that both the assembler and the simulator write to `stdout`


*make sure that in case of overflow max value is fed into the variable
*same for underflow
*make sure no of instructions are less than or equal to 255 so that you can put the value of memory address in place
