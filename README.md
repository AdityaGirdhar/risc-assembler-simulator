# Custom Assembler and Simulator
Here's an assembler and simulator based on a hypothetical instruction set architecture implemented in Python3.

This is a project for CSE112 - Computer Organisation, IIIT Delhi.

## Adding code
* Add the assembler code in `Simple-Assembler` directory
* Add the simulator code in the `Simple-Simulator` directory
* Make sure that both the assembler and the simulator read from `input.txt`
* Make sure that both the assembler and the simulator write to `output.txt`


## Known bugs
* No movr, mov acts as movi
* var assigning needs to be tested
* No support for labels (yet)
